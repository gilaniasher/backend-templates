# Backend Templates
I use serverless REST APIs for a lot of projects and I wanted to put them all in one place. These backend templates offer the following features:
* Local server for Lambdas
* Local DynamoDB tables
* Hot reloading
* Code reuse across Lambda
* Easy AWS deployments
* Request schema validation (for TypeScript)

# Available Languages
Click the following links to download the appropriate backend template as a ZIP. Will have to provide your Github PAT token since this is a private repo right now.

* [TypeScript](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https://github.com/gilaniasher/backend-templates/tree/main/typescript-backend)
* [Python](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https://github.com/gilaniasher/backend-templates/tree/main/python-backend)

Use the following command to unzip to a directory:
```
unzip template.zip -d typescript-backend
```
